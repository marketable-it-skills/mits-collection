# Taitaja 2025

## Module B
- Only reviewed by reading, since only the 2023 repo is available in SharePoint  
- `readme.md` file contains a deploy section, but it doesn’t appear in the output.  
  ❓**Question:** Can I also delete it from `readme.md`, not only if it’s included as a separate file in the test project?

# WorldSkills Lyon 2024

## Module B
- **Marking**
  - B1: 4th unit is missing (0.25 points). ❓**Question:** Was this left out intentionally or by mistake?  
  - B2-B3, B4-B5-B6 order is different in the original table compared to the marking.  
    ❓**Question:** Does the order matter?  
- Deleted the empty deploy section from `readme.md`  

## Module C
- The test project description contains a different image than the PDF, but the content is essentially the same  
- ❌Instead of Module C’s marking, Module B’s marking scheme is included  
- Deleted the empty deploy section from `readme.md`  

## Module D
- On the MITS interface, the card for this module does not appear  (draft mode)  
- Deleted the empty deploy section from `readme.md`  
- In the original repo under `assets`, there are `module_d_api.php` and `module_d_api-cors-version.php` files,  
  but they are not included in the test project.  
  ❓**Question:** Are these files required, or are they replaced by the dockerized mock-api-server?  
- ❌ Instead of Module D’s marking, Module B (Admin) marking scheme is included
