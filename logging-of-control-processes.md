# WorldSkills Lyon 2024

## Module B

- **Marking**
  - B1: 4th unit is missing (0.25 points). ❓**Question:** Was this left out intentionally or by mistake?
  - B2-B3, B4-B5-B6 order is different in the original table compared to the marking.  
    ❓**Question:** Does the order matter?
- Deleted the empty deploy section from `readme.md`

## Module C

- The test project description contains a different image than the PDF, but the content is essentially the same
- ❌Instead of Module C’s marking, Module B’s marking scheme is included
- Delete the empty deploy section from `readme.md`

## Module D

- On the MITS interface, the card for this module does not appear (draft mode)
- Delete the empty deploy section from `readme.md`
- In the original repo under `assets`, there are `module_d_api.php` and `module_d_api-cors-version.php` files,  
  but they are not included in the test project.  
  ❓**Question:** Are these files required, or are they replaced by the dockerized mock-api-server?
- ❌ Instead of Module D’s marking, Module B (Admin) marking scheme is included

## Module E

- assets is correct
- ❓**Question:** In the Marking, items 4.3–4.7 are shown as a dropdown list like a judgement type,  
  but in the JSON file the type is `measurement`. The scoring table also lists the type as `measurement`.  
  Shouldn’t this then be `pass-or-fail` values instead?

- ❓**Question:** In the `project-description.md` file, the "Mark distribution" block defines different descriptions  
  and values compared to the PDF, including a different total score.  
  Which scoring scheme should be used?

The PDF contains the following table:

|           | Sub-Criteria        | Marks  |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| 1         | Loading image files | 2.75   |
| 2         | Ordering photos     | 1.5    |
| 3         | Slides Operating    | 2.5    |
| 4         | Theme               | 6.5    |
| 5         | Command Bar         | 3.75   |
| **Total** |                     | **17** |

## Module F

- In the description, the `layout-map-attraction.jpg` image is not displayed,  
  but afterwards the text states it is the reference, so I considered this correct.

- ❓**Question:** Similar to the previous module, in the `project-description.md` file,  
  the "Mark distribution" block defines different descriptions and values compared to the PDF,  
  including a different total score. Which scoring scheme should be used?

The PDF contains the following table:

|           | Sub-Criteria                     | Marks    |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1         | Responsive loading               | 2.25     |
| 2         | Video playback                   | 2.0      |
| 3         | Design and Layout Implementation | 2.75     |
| 4         | Effects                          | 3.0      |
| 5         | Accessibility                    | 2.5      |
| 6         | Tabs                             | 1.0      |
| **Total** |                                  | **13.5** |

- Assets are correct
- ❓**Question (Effects section in Marking):** For items 4.1 and 4.3, they appear as dropdowns like a judgement,  
  but in the JSON file the type is `measurement`. The scoring table also lists the type as `measurement`.  
  Shouldn’t this then be `pass-or-fail` values instead?

# Taitaja 2024

## Module B

- Delete the deploy section from `readme.md`
- ❓ **Question:** In the marking scheme there are only 6.5 points, but in the description 30 points are listed.  
  I don’t have the source table, so I cannot compare.

# Hungary-Romania Training 2023

## Module A

- Assets are correct
- ❌ The marking table contains different evaluation criteria compared to the test project in Section 1,  
  but the total score is the same.  
  Example: _General layout and implementation, Header section, Featured Restaurants section ..._
- ❌ In the test project marking, under point 3.2, for resolution the symbol between the two numbers is missing,  
  and instead a question mark appears.
